### Associated Web Site
#### 2025-02-20
I've begun to create the associated web site where you can see the live examples running & learn more about the book.<br>
See: <a href="https://makegameswithjs.com" target="_blank">https://makegameswithjs.com</a><br>

Right now the site is very basic, but more will be coming soon.

### HTTP Server To Run Examples
You may need an http server to run the exmamples and here is one that's really easy to use (if you already have node / npm):
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
1. install it globally - (so you can run it from anywhere on your system): npm install --global http-server
2. run it on the port you want: http-server -p <port-number> http-server -p 5500
